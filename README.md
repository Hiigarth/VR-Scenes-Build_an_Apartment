# Build an Apartment
Starter project for the Udacity [VR Developer Nanodegree](http://udacity.com/vr) program.

- Course: VR Scenes & Objects
- Project: Build an Apartment

# About
This project was built by Davide Dell'Aria. The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing apartment with nice lighting and implement VR functionality.

Target device: Android.

This project was done in two days, my favorite part was doing the animation about the globe because I like to work on the interaction. The most challenging thing was lighting because they need a lot of accuracy and attention.
